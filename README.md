# Potholes Detection 

This project is for my final year research testing yolov8 segmentation model from [ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and used the YOLOv8l-seg version to train on my potholes dataset from [roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).
I trained this on a dataset of 200 images and with 120 epochs. The result is in the below video and it could be improved if it was trained on more data and more epochs.
